    <!-- Device-specific array of SIM slot indexes which are are embedded eUICCs.
         e.g. If a device has two physical slots with indexes 0, 1, and slot 1 is an
         eUICC, then the value of this array should be:
             <integer-array name="non_removable_euicc_slots">
                 <item>1</item>
             </integer-array>
         If a device has three physical slots and slot 1 and 2 are eUICCs, then the value of
         this array should be:
             <integer-array name="non_removable_euicc_slots">
                <item>1</item>
                <item>2</item>
             </integer-array>
         This is used to differentiate between removable eUICCs and built in eUICCs, and should
         be set by OEMs for devices which use eUICCs. -->
